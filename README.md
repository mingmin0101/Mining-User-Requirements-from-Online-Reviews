# Mining-User-Requirements-from-Online-Reviews
2021 Introduction-to-Information-Retrieval-and-Text-Mining Final Project

## Abstract
Our study focused on analyzing customer satisfaction based on users reviews obtained from the Steam platform. We selected the popular game group from Top Sellers’ Board and filtered the rest of games as the unpopular game group. After getting the two groups of data, we conducted two kinds of analysis. First of all, we tried to extract the patterns of two groups and compared them by using the tf-idf method. Second, we mined the user requirements by extracting the topics from users reviews of the two groups, and interpreted the result based on the concept of the Kano model. From the Kano model, we expected to analyze what factors are important to game developers in the development process of a new game, and provide companies some suggestions or directions to improve the sales of current games.

## Proposed method
This study consists of two analysis parts. We selected the popular game group from Top Sellers’ Board and filtered the rest of games as the unpopular game group. First of all, we tried to extract the patterns of two groups and compared them. Second, we mined the user requirements by extracting the topics from users reviews of the two groups, and interpreted the result based on the concept of the Kano model.
